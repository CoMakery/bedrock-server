# bedrock-server

A [bedrock][] module that provides a basic HTTP and HTTPS server. Other
modules, such as [bedrock-express][], typically provide a routing framework
and other features for writing Web applications, but depend on this module
for core low-level functionality like listening for incoming connections,
redirecting HTTP traffic to the HTTPS port, and configuring SSL/TLS.

## Quick Examples

```
npm install bedrock-server
